## Introduction
```
Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),

LACP, as specified in IEEE 802.3ad, implements dynamic link aggregation and de-aggregation, 
allowing LACP-enabled switches at both ends to exchange Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Units (LACPDUs). 
LACP provides a standard negotiation mechanism that a Huawei switch can use to create and enable the aggregated link based on its configuration. 
After an aggregated link is formed, LACP is responsible for maintaining the link. LACP adjusts the link if an aggregated link's status changes.

For example, in Figure 1, four interfaces on DeviceA should be connected to the corresponding interfaces on DeviceB, 
and these interfaces are all bundled into an Eth-Trunk. However, one interface on DeviceA is connected to an interface on DeviceC. 
As a result, DeviceA may send data destined for DeviceB to DeviceC. In manual mode, this fault would go undetected.

In this case, if LACP is enabled on DeviceA and DeviceB, the Eth-Trunk only selects active links (links connected to DeviceB) to forward data after negotiation. 
Data sent by DeviceA destined for DeviceB only reaches DeviceB.

                 link1
DeviceA+--------------------------------+DeviceB
       |         link2                  |
       |--------------------------------|
       |         link3                  |
       |--------------------------------|
       |         link4                  
       |--------------------------------+DeviceC


The concepts in LACP include:

LACP system priority:
LACP system priorities determine the sequence in which devices at two ends of an Eth-Trunk select active interfaces to join a LAG. 
In order for a LAG to be established, both devices must select the same interfaces as active interfaces. 
To achieve this, one device (with a higher priority) is responsible for selecting the active interfaces. 
The other device (with a lower priority) then selects the same interfaces as active interfaces. In priority comparisons, 
numerically lower values have higher priority.

LACP interface priority:
LACP interface priorities affect which interfaces of an Eth-Trunk are selected as active interfaces. 
A smaller numerical value represents a higher priority. The interfaces with the highest LACP interface priority become active interfaces.

M:N backup of member interfaces:
LACP mode is also called M:N mode, where M refers to the number of active links and N refers to the number of backup links. 
This mode guarantees high reliability and allows traffic to be load balanced among M active links.

In Figure 2, M+N links with the same attributes (in the same LAG) are set up between two devices. 
When data is transmitted over the aggregated link, traffic is load balanced among M active links, with no data transmitted over N backup links. 
Therefore, the actual bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the M links' bandwidth, 
and the maximum bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the (M+N) links' bandwidth.

If one of the M links fails, LACP selects one of the N backup links to replace the faulty link. 
The actual bandwidth of the aggregated link is still the sum of M links' bandwidth, 
but the maximum bandwidth of the aggregated link is the sum of the (M+N-1) links' bandwidth.

``` 

## LACP Implementation
```
# 先根据system priority选举出Actor，然后由Actor选择active port。

LACP-enabled switches exchange LACPDUs. An LACPDU contains the LACP system priority, MAC address, LACP interface priority, interface number, and operational key.

An Eth-Trunk in LACP mode is set up as follows:
1.After member interfaces are added to an Eth-Trunk in LACP mode, both ends send LACPDUs.
2.Devices at both ends determine the Actor and active links.

In Figure 2, when DeviceB receives LACPDUs from DeviceA, DeviceB checks and records information about DeviceA and compares LACP system priorities. 
If the LACP system priority of DeviceA is higher than that of DeviceB, DeviceA becomes the Actor. 
If DeviceA and DeviceB have the same LACP system priority, the device with a smaller MAC address becomes the Actor.

After the Actor is selected, both devices select active interfaces based on the interface priorities of the Actor. 
If priorities of interfaces on the Actor are the same, interfaces with smaller interface numbers are selected as active interfaces. 
An Eth-Trunk is established when both devices select the same interfaces as active interfaces. Active links then load balance traffic.

```

## Load Balancing
```
# 根据流进行balancing，两端各自进行balancing，所以收发可能走不同的link。

Because an Eth-Trunk between two devices consists of multiple physical links bundled together, 
an Eth-Trunk may transmit data frames of the same data flow over different physical links. 
A potential problem arises in that the second data frame may arrive at the remote device earlier than the first data frame, resulting in out-of-order packets.

To prevent out-of-order packets, Eth-Trunk uses flow-based load balancing. 
This mechanism uses the hash algorithm to calculate the address in a data frame 
and generate a hash key based on which the system searches for the outbound interface in the Eth-Trunk forwarding table. 
Each MAC or IP address corresponds to a hash key, so the system uses different outbound interfaces to forward data. 
This mechanism ensures that frames of the same data flow are forwarded on the same physical link and implements load balancing of data flows. 
Flow-based load balancing ensures that data is transmitted in the correct sequence, but cannot ensure efficient bandwidth usage.

You can set the load balancing mode based on traffic models. When a parameter of traffic changes frequently, 
you can set the load balancing mode based on this parameter to ensure that the traffic is load balanced evenly. 
For example, if IP addresses in packets change frequently, use the load balancing mode based on dst-ip, src-ip, 
or src-dst-ip so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links. 
If MAC addresses in packets change frequently and IP addresses are fixed, use the load balancing mode based on 
dst-mac, src-mac, or src-dst-mac so that traffic can be properly load balanced among physical links.
