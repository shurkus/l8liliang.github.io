# We will use a pretrained architecture and pass our two images through it. 
# Then we can concatenate the results and send them to a custom head that will return two predictions. 
# In terms of modules, this looks like this:
class SiameseModel(Module):
    def __init__(self, encoder, head):
        self.encoder,self.head = encoder,head
    
    def forward(self, x1, x2):
        ftrs = torch.cat([self.encoder(x1), self.encoder(x2)], dim=1)
        return self.head(ftrs)

# To create our encoder, we just need to take a pretrained model and cut it, as we explained before. 
# The function create_body does that for us; we just have to pass it the place where we want to cut. 
# As we saw earlier, per the dictionary of metadata for pretrained models, the cut value for a resnet is -2:
encoder = create_body(resnet34, cut=-2)

# Then we can create our head. A look at the encoder tells us the last layer has 512 features, so this head will need to receive 512*2. 
# Why 2? We have to multiply by 2 because we have two images. So we create the head as follows:
encoder[-1]
head = create_head(512*2, 2, ps=0.5)

# With our encoder and head, we can now build our model:
model = SiameseModel(encoder, head)

# Before using Learner, we have two more things to define. First, we must define the loss function we want to use. 
# Itâ€™s regular cross-entropy, but since our targets are Booleans, we need to convert them to integers or PyTorch will throw an error:
def loss_func(out, targ):
    return nn.CrossEntropyLoss()(out, targ.long())

# A splitter is a function that tells the fastai library how to split the model into parameter groups. 
# These are used behind the scenes to train only the head of a model when we do transfer learning.
# Here we want two parameter groups: one for the encoder and one for the head. 
# We can thus define the following splitter (params is just a function that returns all parameters of a given module):
def siamese_splitter(model):
    return [params(model.encoder), params(model.head)]

# Since we are not using a convenience function from fastai for transfer learning (like vision_learner), we have to call learn.freeze manually. 
# This will make sure only the last parameter group (in this case, the head) is trained:
learn = Learner(dls, model, loss_func=loss_func, 
                splitter=siamese_splitter, metrics=accuracy)
learn.freeze()

learn.fit_one_cycle(4, 3e-3)

# Before unfreezing and fine-tuning the whole model a bit more with discriminative learning rates (that is: a lower learning rate for the body and a higher one for the head):
learn.unfreeze()
learn.fit_one_cycle(4, slice(1e-6,1e-4))
```
